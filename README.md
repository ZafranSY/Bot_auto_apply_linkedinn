## ⚙️ How to install

1. [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/) or above. Visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download and install Python, or for windows you could visit Microsoft Store and search for "Python". **Please make sure Python is added to Path in System Environment Variables**.
2. Install necessary [Undetected Chromedriver](https://pypi.org/project/undetected-chromedriver/), [PyAutoGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/) and [Setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/) packages. After Python is installed, OPEN a console/terminal or shell, Use below command that uses the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable) command-line tool to install these 3 package.
  ```
  pip install undetected-chromedriver pyautogui setuptools openai flask-cors flask
  ```
3. Download and install latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) in it's default location, visit https://www.google.com/chrome to download it's installer.
4. Clone the current git repo or download it as a zip file.
5. (Not needed if you set `stealth_mode = True` in `config/settings.py` ) Download and install the appropriate [Chrome Driver](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/) for Google Chrome and paste it in the location Chrome was installed, visit https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/ to download.

  ***OR*** 
  <br> <br>
  If you are using Windows, click on `windows-setup.bat` available in the `/setup` folder, this will install the latest chromedriver automatically.

## 🔧 How to configure
1. Open `personals.py` file in `/config` folder and enter your details like name, phone number, address, etc. Whatever you want to fill in your applications.
2. Open `questions.py` file in `/config` folder and enter your answers for application questions, configure wether you want the bot to pause before submission or pause if it can't answer unknown questions.
3. Open `search.py` file in `/config` folder and enter your search preferences, job filters, configure the bot as per your needs (these settings decide which jobs to apply for or skip).
4. Open `secrets.py` file in `/config` folder and enter your LinkedIn username, password to login and OpenAI API Key for generation of job tailored resumes and cover letters (This entire step is optional). If you do not provide username or password or leave them as default, it will login with saved profile in browser, if failed will ask you to login manually.
5. Open `settings.py` file in `/config` folder to configure the bot settings like, keep screen awake, click intervals (click intervals are randomized to seem like human behavior), run in background, stealth mode (to avoid bot detection), etc. as per your needs.
6. (Optional) Don't forget to add you default resume in the location you mentioned in `default_resume_path = "all resumes/default/resume.pdf"` given in `/config/questions.py`. If one is not provided, it will use your previous resume submitted in LinkedIn or (In Development) generate custom resume if OpenAI APT key is provided!
7. Run `runAiBot.py` and see the magic happen.
8. To run the Applied Jobs history UI, run `app.py` and open web browser on `http://localhost:5000`.

## 🧑‍💻 Contributor Guidelines
Thank you for your efforts and being a part of the community. All contributions are appreciated no matter how small or big. Once you contribute to the code base, your work will be remembered forever.

NOTE: Only Pull request to `community-version` branch will be accepted. Any other requests will be declined by default, especially to main branch.
Once your code is tested, your changes will be merged to the `main` branch in next cycle.

### Code Guidelines
  #### Functions:
  1. All functions or methods are named lower case and snake case
  2. Must have explanation of their purpose. Write explanation surrounded in `''' Explanation '''` under the definition `def function() -> None:`. Example:
      ```python
      def function() -> None:
        '''
        This function does nothing, it's just an example for explanation placement!
        '''
      ```
  4. The Types `(str, list, int, list[str], int | float)` for the parameters and returns must be given. Example:
      ```python
      def function(param1: str, param2: list[str], param3: int) -> str:
      ```
  5. Putting all that together some valid examples for function or method declarations would be as follows.
      ```python
      def function_name_in_camel_case(parameter1: driver, parameter2: str) -> list[str] | ValueError:
        '''
        This function is an example for code guidelines
        '''
        return [parameter2, parameter2.lower()]
      ```
  6. The hashtag comments on top of functions are optional, which are intended for developers `# Comments for developers`.
      ```python
      # Enter input text function
      def text_input_by_ID(driver: WebDriver, id: str, value: str, time: float=5.0) -> None | Exception:
          '''
          Enters `value` into the input field with the given `id` if found, else throws NotFoundException.
          - `time` is the max time to wait for the element to be found.
          '''
          username_field = WebDriverWait(driver, time).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, id)))
          username_field.send_keys(Keys.CONTROL + "a")
          username_field.send_keys(value)
      
      ```
   
  #### Variables
  1. All variables must start with lower case, must be in explainable full words. If someone reads the variable name, it should be easy to understand what the variable stores.
  2. All local variables are camel case. Examples:
      ```python
      jobListingsElement = None
      ```
      ```python
      localBufferTime = 5.5
      ```
  3. All global variables are snake case. Example:
      ```
      total_runs = 1
      ```
  4. Mentioning types are optional.
      ```python
      localBufferTime: float | int = 5.5
      ```
  
  #### Configuration variables
  1. All config variables are treated as global variables. They have some extra guidelines.
  2. Must have variable setting explanation, and examples of valid values. Examples:
      ```python
      # Explanation of what this setting will do, and instructions to enter it correctly
      config_variable = "value1"    #  <Valid values examples, and NOTES> "value1", "value2", etc. Don't forget quotes ("")
      ```
      ```python
      # Do you want to randomize the search order for search_terms?
      randomize_search_order = False     # True of False, Note: True or False are case-sensitive
      ```
      ```python
      # Avoid applying to jobs if their required experience is above your current_experience. (Set value as -1 if you want to apply to all ignoring their required experience...)
      current_experience = 5             # Integers > -2 (Ex: -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4...)
      ```
      ```python
      # Search location, this will be filled in "City, state, or zip code" search box. If left empty as "", tool will not fill it.
      search_location = "United States"               # Some valid examples: "", "United States", "India", "Chicago, Illinois, United States", "90001, Los Angeles, California, United States", "Bengaluru, Karnataka, India", etc.

      ```
  4. Add the config variable in appropriate `/config/file`.
  5. Every config variable must be validated. Go to `/modules/validator.py` and add it over there. Example:
      For config variable `search_location = ""` found in `/config/search.py`, string validation is added in file `/modules/validator.py` under the method `def validate_search()`.
      ```python
      def validate_search() -> None | ValueError | TypeError:
          '''
          Validates all variables in the `/config/search.py` file.
          '''
          check_string(search_location, "search_location")
      ```
